title: "Applied Regression in R"
---

The course Applied Regression in R is developed and taught at [*Department of Sociology, Faculty of Arts, Charles University*](https://ksoc.ff.cuni.cz/) in Prague.
On this webpage, the course content is made available to everyone to promote open learning. You will find course notes covering the essentials of each lecture, and course slides we (sometimes) use in teaching under the *Lectures* tab.
The *Practice* tab offers exercise for training. All data we use throughout the course can be downloaded in *Materials* section, where you can also find the list of recommended literature.
Please, let us know if you spot any errors or other problems.   

### Course Annotation

The course will introduce students to linear regression analysis with emphasis on application in the R software.
The course is designed for social science students, which is reflected in its focus on a conceptual understanding of linear regression and practical applications in the social sciences.
The course contains but a small amount of mathematics, but for those interested we refer also to literature with more technical/mathematical treatment of the topics covered.
After completing the course, students should have a good conceptual understanding of linear regression and the diverse purposes for which it is used (description, sample-to-population inference, causal inference, prediction), should command common terminology, understand assumptions associated with regression modeling, be able to verify them and respond adequately in the event of a failure to honor the assumptions.
Above all, though, they should be able to make well-argued decisions when conducting their own regression analysis, and they should be able to present and interpret the results of thier analysis correctly.
