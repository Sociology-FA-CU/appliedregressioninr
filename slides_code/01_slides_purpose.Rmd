```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)

countries <- read.csv("../data/countries.csv")
```

## Goals for today

- Understand goals of various regression models
- Learn ho to select variables for explanative modeling

## Previously on Applied Regression in R

```{r anonymous-regression, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4.5}

countries %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= dem_index, y = life_exp)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "predictor variabel on x axis\nhere: democratic index 1-10",
       y = "response variable on y axis\nhere: life expectancy") 

  
```

## What is Regression good for?

# To Explain or To Predict?

## To Explain or To Predict?

<div style="float: left; width: 48%; background-color: #ececec;">
<p style="text-align:center">**Predictive models**</p>

- Predicting the future (or the past!)
- Interpretation less important.
- Goal: estimate (unseen) observations as best as possible.
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 48%; background-color: #ececec;">
<p style="text-align:center">**Explanative (causal) models**</p>

- Explaining workings of the universe.
- Predictive power less important.
- Goal: Estimate model parameters as best as possible.
</div>

## To Explain or To Predict?

- Other differences include: choosing variable, evaluating model fit, choosing sample sizes and more...

## Other uses of regression models

<div style="float: left; width: 48%; background-color: #ececec;">
<p style="text-align:center">**Descriptive Models**</p>

- Basicaly just a math summarization
- Goal: Summarize structure of the data
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 48%; background-color: #ececec;">
<p style="text-align: center">**Inferential models**</p>

- Sample to population inference
- Goal: Describe population as best as possible
</div>

## What can regression be used for?

- **Predictive models**: Which people are going to vote?
- **Explanative models**: What is the effect of age on voter turnout?
- **Descriptive models**: What is the relationship between age and voter turnout?
- **Inferential models**: How many people are going to vote?

<br>
- We are going to be mainly interested in explanative models.
