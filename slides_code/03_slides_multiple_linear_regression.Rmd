## Goals for today

- Understanding multiple linear regression
- Building and interpreting multiple linear regression in R
- Coding categorical predictors as dummy variables
- Using and interpreting interactions


## Multiple linear regression

-   More than one predictor term
-   Note, more terms does not necessarily mean more predictors!

<div>

```{r multi-anonymous regression, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5}

countries <- read.csv(here("data", "countries.csv"))

countries %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= dem_index, y = life_exp, color = postsoviet)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ x) +
  labs(x = "predictor variabel on x axis\nhere: democratic index 1-10",
       y = "response variable on y axis\nhere: life expectancy",
       caption = "life_expectancy = democratic_index + is_postsoviet")

countries %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= dem_index, y = life_exp)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, formula = y ~ poly(x,3)) +
  labs(x = "predictor variabel on x axis\nhere: democratic index 1-10",
       y = "response variable on y axis\nhere: life expectancy",
       caption = "life_expectancy = democratic_index + democratic_index^2 + democratic_index^3")
```

## Interpreting coefficients in multivariate regression

- Additional effect: each coefficient represents additional effect of adding the variable in the model
- In other words: individual coefficients show the conditional effect given all the other variables in the model are already accounted for
- This implies that coefficients will change when other variables are added to the model (or dropped from the model)


## What multiple regression is used for

- Descriptive modeling: See effects of individual variables net of the effects of other variables in the model (AKA „when all the other variables are held constant“)
- Predictive modeling: Improve prediction, more variables = more information on the entry = usually better predictions (but risk of overfitting!)
- Modeling for causal inference: adjusting for background variables, discovering potentially spurious relationships

## Dummy variables

- Categorical variables among regressors (predictors): (1) binary factors, (2)



## What are interactions?
